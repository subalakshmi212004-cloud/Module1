Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
🎯 Aim
```
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.
```
🧠 Algorithm
```
1.Get an input from the user.
2.Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
3.Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
4.If true, print "EVEN".
5.Else, print "ODD".
6.End the program.
🧾 Program
```a = int(input())
if a % 2 == 0:
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")
```

****Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
🎯 Aim
```
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.
```
🧠 Algorithm
```
1.Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
2.Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
3.Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
4.Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
5.Print the value of a with the label "a is".
6.Print the value of b with the label "b is".
7.Print the value of c with the label "c:".
8.Print the value of d with the label "d:".
💻 Program
```a = (0 == True)
b = (False == False)
c = (True + True)
d = (False + 9)

print("a is", a)
print("b is", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)
```

**🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
**🎯 Aim
```
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.
```
🧠 Algorithm
```
1.Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
2.Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
3.Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
4.Print the complex number x.
5.Print the real part of x using x.real.
6.Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
💻 Program
```a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```
